# Moodi
An interactive mood tracking app that takes the hassle off the user and makes mood tracking casual and breezy. Chat with Feelix, the friendly Moodi bot who loves to hear about your feelings. Have a short conversation, and Feelix will log your mood for the day.

# Technologies
Moodi was created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). We used Firebase's Cloud Firestore, where we store the data needed to track the user's emotions every day. We also used Google Cloud's Dialogflow to create our very own chat agent, Feelix. We learned about intents, actions, entities, and fulfillment, and had a good time training the bot. It was our developers' first time using these technologies. Our demo uses an Android emulator, but Flutter apps can be used cross-platform.

Our design team worked hard to produce refined low-fi and high-fi wireframes using Figma, working in tandem with the developers as we spent a very long day and two very long nights building Moodi.
